Merge Conflict-
A merge conflict happens when Git tries to merge two branches, but the same part of the same file was changed differently in both branches, so Git doesn’t know which version to keep.     -Edit the file

Pull request-
A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes you've made on a branch (usually a feature or bugfix branch) to be reviewed and merged into another branch (commonly main or master) on GitHub.
